/*  Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x and y-coordinates. The class contains:
Â‡
i. The data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with getter methods.
ii. A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).
iii. A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
iv. A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to a specified point of the MyPoint type.
v. A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another point with specified x- and ycoordinates */
